# WARNING: By default the tools will update RPMs during provisioning. If any packages are
# updated, the host(s) will reboot to ensure the correct versions are in use. This may
# NOT be desirable during an consecutive runs to just apply minor changes. If you would
# like to avoid "surprise" reboots, make sure to uncomment the following variable.
# Do NOTE that a reboot should most likely happen on initial install, so it's important
# that this variable is commented out or set to `True` for initial runs.

# Uncomment the following `additional_list_of_packages_to_install` to list additional
# packages/RPMs to install during install
